## Server Starter

ServerStarter is a simple bash script that uses a text file to find and locate numerous server directories. It is designed to be run on a server's startup in conjunction with something like bungeecord.

In the servers.txt file you can specifiy a directory, host (IP) and pot for a server to start on. Separated by a colon

### Example
```
athena;127.0.0.1;25560
bungee;127.0.0.1;25565
```
This can be modified to run any number of servers, it is not limited to just Bukkit.
